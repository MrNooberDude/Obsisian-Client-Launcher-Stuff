# Obsisian-Client-Launcher-Stuff
Makin' a PvP client for fun and continuing after a good month. This is launcher resources but I'll make a public release soon enough :D
Obsidian Client is a PvP client made from Quickdaffy's tutorials, which are VERY helpful.
It's currently very bland and basic but I might skim through Eric Golde's tutorials as well, just to make sure :)
